a) Why the formula of estimating program length uses logarithm to base 2? Why not something else?
The effective difference in a program between 1 and 2 operators is larger than the 101 to 102 differences. Logarithms were selected to model the decreasing value.

b) Why base 2?
I suggest it was Halstead's own preference. If he had chosen something else like base 10 it would still produce a model comparing the length of two programs roughly the same way. When it does, it will only generate different numbers for each.
Moreover, we are operating in the context of information. Logarithm to base 2 gives us a number representation in bits. Within the computer, all the information is represented as bits.
