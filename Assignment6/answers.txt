(a) What is algebraic expression? How does it differs from mathematical formula?

An algebraic expression is an expression built up from integer constants, variables, and the algebraic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and exponentiation by an exponent that is a rational number). And the formula is the way to express information
symbolically. So the formulas uses math expression to deliver some information, but we can say that in most it is the same things.

(b) What is term rewriting? Is it the same as symbolic computation?

Rewriting is a method to replace something in the formula with some other data. So yes, we think it is the same thing.

(c) What is symbolic computation comparing with numerical computation?

Numerical use only numbers, and in symbolic the symbola are added to the expression.

(d) What is the difference between evaluation and interpretation (in math sense)?

Evaluation means the calculation of the value of.
Interpretation means giving a meaning (value) to mathematical expressions like symbols, formulas, and etc. 

(e) What is lazy evaluation comparing with eager evaluation?

Eager evaluation means that the expressions is being evaluated as soon as it is bound to a variable.
Lazy evaluation means delay of the evaluation of an expression right by the time before its value is required  and that additionally avoids repeated evaluations


(f) How functional programming related to algebra systems?

Functional programming is a branch of discrete mathematics and a programming paradigm. The calculation process is interpreted as calculating the values of functions in the mathematical sense.
